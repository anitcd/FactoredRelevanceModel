# Factored Relevance Model

An implementation of a Factored Relevance Model (FRLM) for (Multi-)Contextual Point-of-Interest Recommendation. This implementation includes factorization (see our initial [SIGIR ICTIR '19 paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3341981.3344230)), trip-qualifier (e.g. 'trip-type', 'accompanied-by') enriched contexts (see our [SIGIR '20 paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3397271.3401197)), and Kernel Density Estimation based generalizations (see the extended version, [KDEFRLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.15679)) of the relevance model.
